/**
 * Reproduce the live scheduler under Node, so a bug in it can be found in
 * seconds instead of by ear.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types dev/live-sim.ts        (LBP_UID picks the song)
 *
 * It builds the plan exactly as `dev/live.ts` does -- `renderSequencer` with
 * `planOnly` and `onVoice` -- and then feeds it to a `Mixer` the way the page
 * feeds the worklet: in look-ahead bursts, with `startFrame` rewritten to a
 * delay and `endFrame`/`cutFrame` rebased onto it. The result is compared
 * against the plain render of the same voices.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The two should be identical, and as of 2026-09-05 they are** -- all
 * three variants render bit for bit against the direct one. They are the same
 * voices with the same specs; only the moment each is handed over differs, and
 * a delay the mixer counts down makes that invisible.
 *
 * ❗ **It took a year of -57 dB to notice the fault was here.** This file used
 * to render `TICK * RATE` frames per call because that is how often it posts
 * notes -- but the worklet posts on the tick and renders **128 frames** per
 * `process()`, and 4,800 frames is 37.5 of the mixer's modulation chunks, so
 * every other burst cut a chunk in half. That was question 34, and it was
 * measuring something the live player never does. If this file and the renderer
 * ever disagree again, suspect this file first: it is the one that has to
 * imitate two cadences at once.
