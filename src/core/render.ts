/**
 * The whole render pipeline, in one platform-neutral function.
 *
 * This is the code `dev/render-level.ts` used to be, lifted out of it verbatim
 * so that **the same pipeline runs under Node and in the browser**. The only
 * thing either wrapper supplies is a way to load an instrument by GUID: Node
 * reads files, the browser fetches them, and nothing else differs. Every
 * measured law -- the sampler, the ladder, the envelopes, the LFOs, the voice
 * pool, the sends, the echo, the reverb and the output clip -- lives below and
 * is exercised identically by both.
 *
 * ⚠️ It renders offline into plain `Float32Array`s rather than through
 * `OfflineAudioContext`. That is the point: the browser's own resampler and
 * mixer are exactly what this project must not use (see
 * `steering/tracker-architecture.md`), so the output has to be arithmetic we
 * control, and it has to be bit-identical to the Node render.
 *
 * ✔ **Measured, 2026-09-02**: `This Is Halloween` rendered end to end under Node
 * and in Chrome produced the same **70,704,044-byte** file with the same
 * SHA-256, `1785d0d8ae658eeb726300aa7726b8d9`. ⚠️ That file predates the
 * voice-pool fix later the same day and is no longer what this code produces;
 * what it is evidence for -- that the two hosts run identical arithmetic -- is
 * unaffected. A test cannot drive a browser, so
 * `test/render.test.ts` pins the property that made that comparison meaningful:
 * the pipeline is deterministic and depends on its seed and nothing else.

 * **`2 - Math.SQRT2` = 0.5857864**, applied as `p' = 0.5 + (p - 0.5) * PAN_WIDTH`.
 *
 * ✔ **Measured against the game's own output at four pan values**, and the last
 * two were a *prediction* confirmed out of sample. Two placements at pan 0.40
 * and 0.60 in `Ascetic` gave a channel ratio of 0.5586 where this renderer gave
 * 0.6000; that fixed a one-parameter family, which predicted **0.261204** for a
 * hard-panned voice. A recording of one instrument at pan 0 and another at pan 1
 * then measured, by least squares over the whole file:
 *
 * ```
 *                        pan 0      pan 1     predicted
 *   opposite / dominant  0.261202   0.261202  0.261204
 *   residual / rms       0.0008     0.0008
 *   correlation, lag     1.000000, 0 samples
 * ```
 *
 * Six significant figures on both files. **A constant-power law over a reduced
 * angle -- the one candidate that is not affine -- predicts 0.198 and is
 * refuted.** The residual and the unit correlation say the quiet channel is the
 * loud one times a constant: no delay, no decorrelation, no reverb of its own.
 *
 * The same numbers in the other two forms, all one law: a mono copy of the voice
 * added to both channels at `c = 2^-1.5 = 0.3535534`, or a cross-bleed of
 * `b = 1 / (1 + 2*sqrt2) = 0.2612039`. `2^-1.5` is `0.5 / sqrt2` -- the mono
 * average of a stereo pair folded back in at the textbook -3 dB, which is what a
 * **centre channel** does.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It happens in the stereo fold, not in the sequencer**, and the two halves
 * have different owners. The game renders **7.1**: `v0xa57770`, FMOD's
 * `GetDriverCaps` for its "FMOD Orbis AudioOut Output" driver, reports
 * `FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_7POINT1`, 48 kHz and float, and `setSpeakerMode` is never
 * called. Eight channels leave the game, and folding 7.1 to stereo cross-feeds
 * **only through the centre**, at the ITU-R BS.775 coefficient `1/sqrt2` --
 * which is what `2^-1.5 = 0.7071 * (L+R)/2` is.
 *
 * So the centre must carry the mono average, and that part is the *game's*: the
 * sequencer itself cannot do it -- its pan law is exactly `1-p` / `p`
 * (`0x2d21`/`0x2d40`), the pan reaches the voice unmodified (`0x3b29`), and its
 * four output channels are one image plus a scaled copy. What has no reading yet
 * is why FMOD feeds the centre when it upmixes that 4-channel DSP into 7.1. See
 * question 22 in steering/open-questions.md.
 *
 * A stereo listener therefore hears this narrowing on hardware or emulator
 * alike, which is why the tracker reproduces it. It does mean the game's
 * **internal** image is wider than what this renders.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Width, not gain.** The recordings were level-matched, so they fix the
 * ratio between the channels and say nothing about the absolute level. This
 * scales the pan and leaves `(left + right)` at 1 exactly as before, changing
 * only the quantity that was measured.

  /**
   * How long a one-shot's gate is held open, in output frames.
   *
   * ## The rule this replaces, and why the corpus refutes it
   *
   * Question 10 established that percussion cannot be gated by its note: 89.4%
   * of the corpus's 673,037 percussion notes last two steps or fewer, and
   * `a_kit_1`'s amplitude envelope is a bare gate, so gating clips a 0.806 s
   * kick to 0.083 s. The rule written from that was **a loopless sample is
   * never gated and plays to the end of the sample**, and it is unbounded.
   *
   * ⚠️ Unbounded is where it breaks, because the length it grants is the
   * *stretched* one. `mime_artist` is four **plucks** (`pluck_a6`..`pluck_a3`,
   * 9,142 frames each, no `smpl` chunk) at base notes 81, 69, 57, 45, with
   * `Numstack` 5. `Ascetic` plays it at notes 13-24 -- 57 to 68 semitones under
   * the base -- so a 0.19 s pluck becomes **9.02 s**, five voices at a time,
   * against notes the composer wrote **0.12 s** long. Measured over that
   * sequencer: peak demand **216 voices, 200 of them `mime_artist`**, against a
   * pool of 32, and its notes score highest so the allocator steals everything
   * else first. A published level cannot sound like that, so the rule is wrong
   * before the pool ever gets involved.
   *
   * ## What it is instead
   *
   * The exemption grants the sample **its own duration**, at its own rate --
   * `sampleFrames * RATE / sampleRate` output frames -- rather than however long
   * the note's pitch happens to stretch it to. A sample's length is a property
   * of the sample; the stretch is a property of the note, and the note already
   * has a gate.
   *
   * For percussion this changes nothing: a kit plays at rate 0.45-1.33, so the
   * natural duration and the stretched one are the same thing, and question 10's
   * drum measurements stand. For `mime_artist` at rate 0.02 it is the difference
   * between a 0.12 s thud -- a pluck's attack at a fiftieth speed, which is what
   * a composer reaching for the bottom octave of a pluck is after -- and a nine
   * second drone.
   *
   * ✔ **SETTLED 2026-09-03, and not in favour of any of this.** The engine
   * gates every voice -- `0x1f65` reads the gate flag and hands it to the
   * envelope with no branch on the loop -- and a recording of the game agrees:
   * `'gate'` beat both of the others in **eight two-second blocks out of
   * eight**. The default is `'gate'`, for which this function returns 0, so the
   * exemption below is now reachable only through `options.oneShot`.
   *
   * ⚠️ Why it took so long is worth keeping: the drums that motivated the
   * exemption were being rendered with the **wrong kick sample**, because two
   * GUIDs collided on one filename. See *10* in
   * `steering/answered-questions.md`.
