/**
 * A sequencer to a MIDI file and back.
 *
 * `sequencerdump` already did the export half, and its author has ruled that
 * layer out as a reference; `steering/lbp-modding-toolchain.md` lists the
 * divergences. This module is the version with those fixed, so it is worth
 * saying which is which:
 *
 * | # | There | Here |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 | grid `floor(x / 52.5)` | never re-derived: `Track.gridX` already carries the game's own `floor(2x/105 - 0.5)` |
 * | 2 | `volume`/`timbre` read as signed bytes | unsigned, from `decodeRecord` |
 * | 3 | duration from the record chain, extra point pushed at `step+1` | `endPosition - startPosition + 1`, the measured reading |
 * | 4 | triplets `group*96 + pos*32`, overrunning the quarter | `step + subStep/3`, exact at 480 PPQ: a third of a step is 40 ticks |
 * | 5 | mixer ignored, tracks grouped by row + instrument | `NumChannels` and `Volume[0..5]` travel in the header meta |
 *
 * And the sixth, which is the reason this file is long: **a note is a chain of
 * control points, not a value.** 53.9% of the corpus's notes carry more than
 * one, and the engine glides linearly between them. A converter that writes the
 * first point and drops the rest loses every pitch bend and every fade in the
 * game. MPE is what lets them survive -- a channel per sounding note, so the
 * glide belongs to the note instead of to the whole part -- and it is why this
 * exports MPE by default.
 *
 * ⚠️ **What a round trip preserves is the music, not the bytes.** Export bakes
 * `Key` and `Scale` into the note numbers, because a MIDI file has to play in
 * something that has never heard of an LBP scale; import therefore produces a
 * chromatic sequencer in C whose record pitches are MIDI note numbers. The
 * scheduled stream matches; the record bytes do not. Clip boundaries move too:
 * a step field is seven bits, so an imported part is re-cut into 128-step clips
 * wherever they fall.

       * already sounding there. So a reader can only tell whose the channel's
       * bend is by asking who arrived first -- and that answer is only useful if
       * the note with the glide is always the earlier one. When a flat note was
       * allowed to start in front of a glide, the glide lost its whole tail: in
       * `Rain` a 32-step fade stopped at volume 30 instead of reaching 0,
       * because the newcomer had claimed the channel and the rest of the ramp
       * went to it.

       *   MASTER    channel 1, which MPE lets carry notes and where nothing is
       *             ever bent, so a note parked there is never dragged
       *   BEHIND    one whose glides all began before this note. Our own
       *             importer knows whose the bend is (see `owners`), but a
       *             synth does not: this note WILL be dragged by it, which is
       *             what `dragged` counts and why the master comes first.
       *   DISPLACE  a channel where a glide has to be given up for this note
       *
       * The last one is a real loss and is counted. Refusing instead of

/**
 * The same song across several files, so that fewer notes have to share.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A MIDI file's tracks do NOT get a channel space each.** The header can
 * declare 65,535 of them and they are still one shared set of sixteen channels:
 * the channel lives in the status byte, and two tracks writing `0x93` address
 * the same channel 4. A track is an editing container. That is the whole reason
 * a dense song runs out of member channels no matter how many tracks it uses,
 * and it is why splitting means splitting into FILES.
 *
 * (There is a `FF 21` MIDI Port meta event that does give a track its own
 * sixteen. It is deprecated, unevenly honoured, and a reader that ignores it
 * collapses every port back onto one channel space with no allocator having
 * planned for the collisions -- overlapping notes of one pitch, ambiguous
 * note-offs, notes left hanging. It is not worth the trade.)
 *
 * Measured over the corpus's 953,791 notes:
 *
 * | | files | dragged | glide lost |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | one file | 149 | 1,245 (0.131%) | 1,535 (0.161%) |
 * | packed, here | 249 | 193 (0.020%) | 1,016 (0.107%) |
 * | one per part | 4,909 | 0 | 825 (0.086%) |
 *
 * One file per part is perfect on drag and unusable in bulk -- `Ascetic` alone
 * becomes 46 files. Packing parts into as few files as their combined polyphony
 * allows gets most of the benefit for two.
