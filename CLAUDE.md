# Steering index — LBP Tracker

Building a faithful re-implementation of LittleBigPlanet 3's in-game **Music Sequencer** as a
standalone tracker, in the browser. "Faithful" is the whole point of the project: the target is not
*a* tracker that sounds nice, it is a tracker whose output you cannot tell apart from the game's.

Rules for this workspace's steering:
- **All steering files must always be written in English.**
- One topic per file under `steering/`. When adding a topic, create `steering/<topic>.md`
  (English, kebab-case name) and add a one-line entry to the list below saying *when to read it*.
- **Each fact lives in exactly one file; every other file points at it.** When a measurement
  changes, change it where it lives and leave the pointers alone. A summary row restating a
  transcript elsewhere is where two copies drift apart, and the drift is invisible because both
  halves look measured.
- Steering holds durable knowledge about the target (the game) and about how we intend to build.
  Session history belongs to the auto-memory. A wrong turn earns a place in
  `answered-questions.md` only if it is a trap the next reader could fall into again, and it is
  written as the trap, not as the story.
- Facts in steering must be **measured**, not remembered. Every non-obvious claim here was taken
  out of the game's own bytes; if you add one, say how you measured it so the next session can
  re-check it. Where something is still a guess, or is a decision rather than a measurement, it
  lives in `open-questions.md`, not in the descriptive files.

Steering files (read on demand, per the hints):
- [steering/project-brief.md](steering/project-brief.md) — **read FIRST**: what we are building,
  what "faithful" means concretely and how far each part of it has been reached, the deliberate
  deviations, scope, and what counts as evidence here.
- [steering/sequencer-data-model.md](steering/sequencer-data-model.md) — **read before writing any
  parser or playback code**: the recovered `PSequencer` / `PInstrument` / `RInstrument` schemas
  with field names and struct offsets, the stream conventions (endianness, stream order, varints,
  revision gates), the 4-byte note record, and the circuit-board timeline.
- [steering/synth-engine.md](steering/synth-engine.md) — **read before touching anything in
  `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src` that makes sound**: what `fmodextinput.prx` does with that data —
  the state block, the clock, the voice, the pitch formula, the sampler, all 27 `Params`, the pan
  law, the voice pool and the echo — with the address of every reading.
- [steering/lbp-audio-engine.md](steering/lbp-audio-engine.md) — read for everything downstream of
  the synthesiser: FMOD Ex 4.44.10 and how little of it the game drives, the sequencer's DSP chain
  (`SMS Reverb`, `SMS WaveHammer`), the 7.1 output stage and the stereo fold.
- [steering/level-files.md](steering/level-files.md) — **read before writing a parser for any LBP
  resource, save or archive**: the container, the Thing stream, plans, streaming chunks, the
  dependency table, `FAR4` saves, the public archive, the corpora, and the reader's version bound.
- [steering/lbp-modding-toolchain.md](steering/lbp-modding-toolchain.md) — read before trusting or
  porting anything from ennuo's toolkit: what it covers, the provenance rule, its known
  approximations, and the table of places we deliberately differ from it.
- [steering/game-assets.md](steering/game-assets.md) — read before touching audio data: where the
  sequencer's samples really are (`.smp` files in the FARCs, by GUID — not the FSB banks), their
  loop points, the FSB4 format and codecs for the SFX side, and the asset-licensing stance.
- [steering/midi-interchange.md](steering/midi-interchange.md) — **read before touching
  `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src/midi.ts`, or before adding a field to `Sequencer` or `Track`**:
  every side channel the MIDI file carries, what each costs over the corpus, and which one can go
  stale.
- [steering/tracker-architecture.md](steering/tracker-architecture.md) — read before starting
  implementation: the three packages and where the seam runs, why the mixer is ours and lives in
  an AudioWorklet, why the web layer has a bundler and Vue and the libraries have neither, the
  live player's invariants, the build order and what exists.
- [steering/eboot-re.md](steering/eboot-re.md) — **read before opening the eboot or a PRX**: the
  address conventions (the delta trap that costs hours), the techniques that worked, and every
  anchor already mapped.
- [steering/tools.md](steering/tools.md) — read before reaching for anything in `tools/` or
  `packages/*/dev/`: what each script is for, the trap each exists because of, and the
  environment variables.
- [steering/open-questions.md](steering/open-questions.md) — **read before planning a work
  session**: the deliberate deviations and what would settle each, the measured residues nothing
  models yet, and the two questions that are not about fidelity at all.
- [steering/answered-questions.md](steering/answered-questions.md) — **read before re-deriving
  anything**: per settled question, the answer in a line, where its measurement now lives, and the
  wrong turns taken on the way — which are the useful part.

## Layout — three npm workspaces, since 2026-09-06

| directory | package | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/cwlib-ts` | `@lbptracker/cwlib` | reading LBP's serialised resources: container, Thing graph, 50 part readers, saves, archives |
| `packages/lbp-tracker-lib` | `@lbptracker/lib` | turning that into sound: sampler, DSP chain, render pipeline, MIDI |
| `packages/lbp-tracker-web` | `@lbptracker/web` | the four pages — Vite, and Vue for the panels |

Each has its own `src/`, `test/` and `dev/`: Node harnesses in the libraries, the typecheck entry
point in the web package. Imports cross by package name:
`import { readWorld } from '@lbptracker/cwlib/level.ts'`.

- `npm install` — **required**: workspaces resolve the package names through symlinks in
  `node_modules`. Nothing is downloaded for the libraries.
- `npm test` — `node --test`, all three workspaces at once, from the root (291 tests, 2026-09-06);
  `npm test -w @lbptracker/lib` for one package.
- `npm run typecheck` — fans out to each package's own `typecheck` script: `tsc -p .` in the two
  libraries, `vue-tsc` for the web package. ⚠️ **The web package checks `.vue` through
  `typescript-native-bridge`**: `vue-tsc` needs a JavaScript API and `typescript@7` is the native
  compiler and has none. See `packages/lbp-tracker-web/dev/typecheck.mjs` and *The toolchain* in
  `steering/tracker-architecture.md`.
- `npm run check` — typecheck, then tests: the one command to run before a commit.
- `npm run serve` / `build` / `preview` — Vite, **in the web package only**; `127.0.0.1:8173` and
  `:8174`.
- `npm run stage` / `deploy` — the site **plus the assets it fetches**, for Cloudflare: `vite
  build`, then `packages/lbp-tracker-web/dev/stage-site.ts` copies `fixtures/rinst` and
  `fixtures/smp` into `dist/fixtures/` under boring names and writes `_headers`; `deploy` then runs
  `wrangler deploy` on `packages/lbp-tracker-web/wrangler.jsonc`. ⚠️ Plain `build` still never
  copies `fixtures/`. *Deployment* in `steering/tracker-architecture.md` has the measurements.
- The libraries depend on each other as `"*"`, so a version bump touches the three manifests and
  nothing else; the web footer reads its version out of its own `package.json`
  (`packages/lbp-tracker-web/src/version.ts`), and a test holds the root manifest to the same number.

❗ **The two libraries have no build step and must keep it that way.** Node runs their TypeScript
directly, so the file the browser executes is the file `node --test` executes, which is what the
fidelity argument rests on. The bundler stops at the web package's edge.

⚠️ **An import map does not reach a Worker or an AudioWorklet** — measured in Chrome, table in
`steering/tracker-architecture.md`. That is *why* the web package has a bundler, and it is the trap
to remember before moving anything into `audio/mixer-worklet.ts`'s import graph: a bare specifier
in there fails to load and the page goes silent with nothing on the main thread to say why.

`fixtures/` is gitignored and always has been: it holds the user's own extracted game data and
other people's levels, and none of it may be committed. Two of its directories are *staged* into a
deployment by the explicit step above; that is the only route out. `steering/tools.md` says how it
is filled.
