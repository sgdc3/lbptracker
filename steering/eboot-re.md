# Reverse-engineering LBP3's eboot and its audio plugins

Read before opening the binary. The address conventions have already cost one session several
hours twice; the rest is the map of what has been found, so the next session extends it instead of
re-deriving it. The tools are catalogued in [tools.md](tools.md).

## The files, and the delta each needs

| file | size | `file = vaddr + …` |
|---|---|---|
| `C:\Users\sgdc3\Desktop\shadPS4\lbp3-ebins\eboot-v128.bin` | 18,497,333 | **`0x4000`** |
| `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063-patch\eboot.bin` (installed fSELF) | 18,506,517 | **`0x8AD0`** |
| `C:\Users\sgdc3\Desktop\shadPS4\lbp3-ebins\eboot-v100.bin` | 17,218,664 | derive it, don't assume |
| `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063-patch\gamedata_orbis\spu\fmodextinput.prx` | 23,794 | **`0x7e0`** for `v0x0`–`0x4b08`; the BSS segment `v0x8000`–`0xd3b0` is at file `0x5310` |
| `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063-patch\gamedata_orbis\spu\fmodsmsreverb.prx` | 16,118 | **`0x7c0`** |
| `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063-patch\gamedata_orbis\spu\fmodsmswavehammer.prx` | 11,870 | `prxdis.py hammer map` |
| `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063-patch\sce_module\libc.prx` | | `prxdis.py libc map` |

⚠️⚠️ **The plugins this project has read are the PATCH copies**, the ones `tools/prxdis.py` and
`tools/prxnid.py` open. The base game's `D:\PS4Games\CUSA00063\gamedata_orbis\spu\` holds
*different* files — 23,614, 14,898 and 11,754 bytes — with a different rodata layout, and a
constant dumped out of one of those at a vaddr from this workspace lands on the wrong value with
no error (measured 2026-09-06: the sampler's `4.0` is at `v0x4584` in the patch file and at
`v0x44f0` in the base one). The eboot is the patch too (`eboot-v128.bin`).

⚠️⚠️ **The delta depends on which file you opened.** `eboot-v128.bin` is the already-peeled ELF —
its own program headers say so (`ebseg.py`: LOAD `off=0x4000, vaddr=0`). The installed `eboot.bin`
is the fSELF, whose container header shifts everything by `0x8AD0`. **All addresses in this
workspace are vaddrs**; convert at the point of use. One-line check: apply the delta to the 4222
script-binding targets and count how many land on a `55 48 89 e5` prologue — the right delta gives
**3559/4222**, a wrong one ~640/4222.

The PRXs are SELFs too: the inner ELF's program headers are not file offsets, and the real offset of
ELF segment `i` is the SELF entry at `0x20 + n*0x20` whose `props >> 20` is `i`. ⚠️⚠️ **Every PRX
address written in this project before 2026-09-02 is 0x40 too high**: `prxdis.py` used `0x7a0` and
`0x780` — the offsets of the 32-byte *digest* blocks that precede those segments. The failure mode
is completely invisible: disassembly from `start` reads `data[start + delta]`, so a uniform delta
error just relabels correct code, and a rip-relative target computed as `vaddr + size + disp` is
read back at `target + delta` — the same error twice, cancelling. **No fact recorded from those
disassemblies is wrong; every address is.** Subtract 0x40 before looking one up.

⚠️ **The failure mode of a wrong eboot delta is silent and convincing too.** The identifier blob is
dense enough that you still read plausible strings — truncated by a byte or two
(`sSlotShareable__Q6SlotID` for `IsSlotShareable__Q6SlotID`) — and the disassembler starts
mid-instruction without complaining. If names look *almost* right, suspect the delta.

❗ **Find the function start before disassembling.** Take the largest `E8` target at or below the
address of interest; when that lands implausibly far away, suspect an indirect call rather than a
long function. `v0x2a1190` cost time twice: it is the `lea rdi, [r14 + 0x4e8]` *inside* the DSP
record builder, whose entry is `v0x2a1144` (`push r14 ; mov r14, rsi`), reached through a vtable
with no direct callers. The same trap in the PRX: `0x250` is inside the scale quantiser, which
starts at `0x240`; `0x3930` is the note walker, not `0x38e0`. A range quoted in a note can stop at
a loop's back-edge — **disassemble past its end**, or you stop before the loop's own conclusion
(the instruction after the stack loop was the whole of question 12).

## The script-binding table

`C:\Users\sgdc3\Desktop\shadPS4\lbp3-re\bindings-1.28.txt` — 4222 `name -> vaddr` pairs. Names
with a `__` suffix are the game's script-VM bindings. They have **no rip-relative reference anywhere
in the binary**, which is why xref hunts for them come back empty: the tables that hold them are
built from `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` relocations, so the pointers exist only as relocation addends.
`lbp3-re\ebrela.py` recovers them by finding the RELA array by shape. ⚠️ Use the **`vaddr` column
only**; the `file` column is computed with the `0x8AD0` delta.

## Techniques that worked here

- **FMOD's code range is derived, not assumed.** FMOD's memory tracker passes `__FILE__` at every
  allocation site, so every rip-relative reference to a `Z:\LBP\sdk\fmod\...cpp` string sits inside
  FMOD code. Collecting those gives FMOD's extent (`v0x9c5da3`–`v0xab6397`) and, per callee, which
  source file it belongs to; every tool in `tools/` marks calls that land there. The same trick
  works for the CWLib paths on the game side.
- **Serialiser walking.** Every LBP resource and part has a serialiser that emits, per field, a
  `lea` to the member offset and a `lea` to the field-name string. Disassemble it linearly and you
  get the whole schema with names — `PSequencer`, `PInstrument`, `RInstrument` and the sample
  slot. ⚠️ `ebschema.py` assumes the member `lea` comes first and the name second; pairing them
  the other way shifts every field by one and still looks plausible.
- **Array element sizes from the growth helper.** An array field passes an element callback whose
  allocation multiplier is the element size (`lea edx, [r13*4]` → 4 bytes) — how `Notes` was
  measured, cross-checked against `Name` giving 1.
- **Field-name neighbourhoods.** Serialiser name strings are packed contiguously, so dumping the
  strings around one known field name usually reveals the whole struct.
- **Import-library names from the dynamic section.** `DT_SCE_IMPORT_LIB` entries encode
  `(id << 48) | (version << 32) | name_offset`; the id maps to the symbol suffix through the same
  base64 alphabet as NIDs. That is how the `FMOD*` libraries and the 5 `libSceAudioOut` imports were
  found, and ⚠️ a NID's `#L#M` suffix names its module — read it before building anything on the
  symbol (`ebdyn.py`).
- ❗ **RTTI names vtables, and this binary has it.** 204 Itanium-mangled `N4FMOD…E` strings
  (measured 2026-09-06 with `N4FMOD[A-Za-z0-9_]+E\0` over the image) and **322 nameable vtables**.
  Three hops, each a lookup in the relocation map: `name -> type_info + 8 -> type_info -> vtable - 8
  -> vtable`; `ebvtable.py` does it in a third of a second. ⚠️ **Every vtable slot is ZERO on
  disk** — this is a PIE and the pointer lives in an `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` addend (plain 24-byte
  `(r_offset, r_info, r_addend)` triples with `r_info == 8`, recoverable by a stride-8 sweep with no
  section headers), so searching the image for a pointer returns nothing, which reads as "no
  RTTI". ⚠️ A pointer to `X`'s type_info comes from `X`'s vtable *and* from every derived class's
  `__si_class_type_info` at `type_info + 16`; half the candidates a naive walk finds are
  type_infos, and dumping one prints strings where functions should be. Require slot 0 to be code.
- **Naming a slot, once the class is named.** Nothing carries method names; identify a slot from the
  call site's *shape*: `v0xa0b539` calls `[vtable + 0x98]` with two floats and no integer, which is
  `setPan(pan, spread)` on a `ChannelSoftware` and could not be the four-argument
  `DSP::setDefaults` a structural search had offered.
- **Relocation addends over segment arithmetic.** The scale table's address was computed from the
  SELF mapping once and landed 48 bytes early on a row of zeros; the `R_X86_64_RELATIVE` addend on
  the pointer slot is the number. Read the relocation; do not compute the address.
- **Run the thing.** `tools/runhammer.py` loads a PRX into a Windows process; it settled in a minute
  what three static readings had got wrong (an absolute-offset search is only sound if every access
  uses the same base).
- **Byte-scan for `E8` displacements** landing on a known callee to find its callers, then search
  backwards for `55 48 89 e5` for the caller's prologue — how the channel-banding writer was found.
  `ebxref.py` does it in vaddr space.

`fmodextinput.prx` exports exactly one symbol, `wycAbBCjLI4` at `0x170`; its LOAD segments are
`vaddr 0x0000 size 0x4ab0` and `vaddr 0x8000 filesz 0x210 memsz 0x53a0`; its imports and the
dynlibdata offsets are in [synth-engine.md](synth-engine.md), along with every function read
inside it (`0xa90` the block function, `0x1c60` the per-voice renderer, `0x3930` the note walker,
