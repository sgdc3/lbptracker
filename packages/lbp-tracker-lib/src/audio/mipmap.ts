 * `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src/audio/interpolate.ts` holds interpolators as a family so they can be
 * compared. This file holds something different: **one function that does what
 * `0x3780` in `fmodextinput.prx` does**, including the parts that are not
 * "quality" choices at all -- the octave mipmapping and the exact shape of the
 * loop wrap. See *The sampler* in steering/synth-engine.md.
 *
 * The two halves of the design only make sense together. Linear interpolation
 * alone measures 19 dB SNR at 4 kHz, which is poor; the game never asks it to
 * stretch further than one octave, because past that it swaps the source for a
 * pre-decimated copy. Implementing the lerp without the mipmapping reproduces
 * the weakness and not the compensation, which is worse than either.

/**
 * **MEASURED: the copies are a pair average.**
 *
 * The builder is `fmodextinput.prx` `0x12e0`, and it is a plain average of
 * adjacent frames:
 *
 * ```
 * 0x1303  len/2 -> [rdi+0x28], [rdi+0x40]      ; the halved copy's length (stored 0x131f, 0x132b)
 * 0x1310  len/4 -> [rdi+0x50], [rdi+0x68]      ; and the quartered one's (0x132f, 0x133b)
 * 0x136e  esi = (int16)src[2i]
 * 0x1379  edx = (int16)src[2i | 2]             ; the next frame of that channel
 * 0x137d  edx += esi
 * 0x13b4  ebx = edx; ebx >>>= 31; ebx += edx; ebx >>= 1
 * 0x13bd  dst[i] = (int16)ebx
 * ```
 *
 * The `| 2` rather than `+ 1` is because the buffer is **interleaved stereo**:
 * elements `2i` and `2i|2` are consecutive frames of the same channel, and
 * `0x13c0` onward repeats the whole thing on the odd elements for the other.
 * Per channel it is exactly `(a + b) / 2`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The arithmetic is int16 and rounds toward zero.** The `shr` by one after
 * adding the sign bit is a signed halve that works because only the low 16 bits
 * are kept, so the result lands back on the sample grid. `(a + b) * 0.5` in
 * floats differs by under an LSB, which is still a difference the brief cares
 * about.
 *
 * The `.smp` files almost certainly hold level 0 only: they are plain RIFF with
 * a single `data` chunk, and their `smpl` loop points land where a loop belongs
 * in the audible material rather than in the first 57% that extra levels would
 * leave.

 * compared against the slot's frame count) and converts at read time, so the
 * loop arithmetic never has to know which copy is being read.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Two details here are the engine's, not conventional sampler practice.**
 * Both were read off `0x3780` and both are audible at the wrap:
 *
 * 1. **Only the integer index is wrapped; the second tap is not.** At the last
 *    frame of the loop the engine interpolates towards the frame that follows
 *    it *in the buffer* -- and the eboot's loader has put the loop's first
 *    frame there (`patchLoop` in `wav.ts`: 16 frames of the loop's start
 *    copied past its end), so on a buffer built by `engineSample` the join is
 *    seamless by construction. On a raw buffer it reads whatever follows the
 *    loop in the file, which is what this did for every sample until
 *    2026-09-08.
 * 2. **The wrap triggers on `>` , not `>=`.** Index `loop.end` is read
 *    directly -- the patched frame, equal to `loop.start`'s -- and the frame
 *    after it maps to `loop.start + 1`, so the two readings agree and the
 *    period is exactly `end − start` frames.
