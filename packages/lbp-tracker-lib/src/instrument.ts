/**
 * Which slot plays a given note.
 *
 * `Splitnotes` is a **descending list of bounds, each belonging to the zone
 * above it**: slot `i` covers `splitNotes[i+1] <= note < splitNotes[i]`, slot 0
 * takes everything at or above `splitNotes[1]`, and the last slot runs down to
 * 0. `splitNotes[0]` is 87 in every instrument and is never consulted — it is a
 * constant the editor writes, not a ceiling (creators play up to note 95).
 *
 * **Established against the game's own 68 instruments:**
 *
 * - **62 of 68 have exactly one non-zero split per used slot** — the fencepost
 *   the layout implies, and strong evidence the two lists are paired by index.
 * - **63 of 68 have every slot reachable** under this rule, and **73.5% of all
 *   slots resolve their own base note to themselves** (189 of 257) against
 *   56.8% for the `<=` variant. That gap is what settles the comparison.
 * - `baiyon_city_guildford` fits exactly: bounds `87, 73, 61, 49, 37, 25, 14,
 *   13` over bases `84, 72, 60, 48, 36, 24, 13, 12` puts every base note inside
 *   its own zone, eight for eight.
 *
 * **The walk is the engine's, read out of `fmodextinput.prx` at `0x05a0`** (and
 * again, identically, at `0x0a40`):
 *
 * ```
 * bextr ecx, r12d, 0x708          ; note = bits 8..14 of the note word
 * xor   eax, eax                  ; i = 0
 * loop: cmp eax, 7
 *       jg  done                  ; i > 7 -> slot 0
 *       cmp [rdx + rax*4 + 0x4c4], ecx   ; splitNotes[i + 1] vs note
 *       lea rax, [rax + 1]
 *       jg  loop                  ; keep going while splitNotes[i + 1] > note
 *       dec eax
 *       mov r8d, eax              ; slot = i
 * ```
 *
 * Three things fall out of it, and all three were open before:
 *
 * - **The comparison is strict.** The loop continues while `splitNotes[i+1] >
 *   note`, so a note sitting exactly on a bound belongs to the zone **above**
 *   it. This decides 215,449 of 968,829 corpus notes -- 22.2%, across 47 of the
 *   68 instruments -- which is how many sit exactly on a bound.
 * - **The walk starts at `splitNotes[1]`.** The displacement is `0x4c4`, and the
 *   array begins at `0x4c0`, so `splitNotes[0]` (87 on every instrument the game
 *   ships) is a ceiling that is never compared.
 * - **The cap is a fixed 8**, not a slot count. `usable` below clamps further to
 *   the slots we actually hold, which never changes the answer: the entries past
 *   the last real bound are zero, and `0 > note` is false for every note.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The note is the raw field, not the quantised one.** `bextr ..., 0x708`
 * takes bits 8..14 of the note word directly; the scale quantiser applies to the
 * *pitch*, not to the slot choice. Only 185 corpus notes are on a non-chromatic
 * scale and none of them changes slot, so this costs nothing today -- but a
 * project authored in a scale would diverge.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Do not test this rule by asking whether a zone contains its own base
 * note.** That measures the sound designer, not the engine, and it cost a whole
 * session once -- and it was also the argument that had been standing in for a
 * proof of the strict comparison, which the loop above now supplies. `piano` sets its bounds `87, 66, 54, 40, 30` against bases
 * `84, 72, 60, 48, 36` — every bound about six semitones below its slot's base
 * — so the piano is voiced to *always transpose downward*, which is the normal
 * sampler preference since pitching up thins a sample out. `guildford` centres
 * its samples instead. Both are legitimate voicings of the same rule, and
 * scoring rules on "base in zone" ranks voicing styles, not correctness.
 *
 * @param slotCount how many slots actually hold a sample. NOT `numStack` --
 *        see the note on that field.
 */
/**
 * How many key zones an instrument actually has.
 *
 * **The zone count comes from `Splitnotes`, not from how many slots hold a
 * sample.** The bounds run downward and the array is zero-filled past the last
 * one, so the count is the number of leading non-zero entries.
 *
 * On **62 of the game's 68 instruments** that equals the number of slots with a
 * sample, which is why the difference went unnoticed. The six that disagree
 * disagree for two different reasons:
 *
 * - `conga`, `djembe`, `dumbek` and `ukulele` carry **spare slots**: six bounds
 *   (`87,60,48,36,24,12`) against seven samples, the seventh with a base note
 *   out of sequence with the rest.
 * - `mime_artist` has **one** bound and four samples, with `Numstack` 5 -- its
 *   slots are stack layers rather than zones.
 *
 * Counting slots instead of bounds invents zones below the last bound. They are
 * unreachable, so nothing played differently -- **zero of the corpus's
 * 2,027,633 notes change slot** -- but they showed up as eight phantom
 * "unreachable slots" and made this rule look broken when it was not. Counting
 * bounds leaves exactly one, `ukulele`, whose bounds are `87,60,40,40,16,12`:
 * a genuinely empty zone in the game's own data.
