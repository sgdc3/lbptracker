/**
 * The song as the editor holds it: a board of clips, each a grid of notes.
 *
 * `Sequencer` and `Track` in `@lbptracker/cwlib/project.ts` are what a level
 * file yields -- immutable, with the file's own record bytes beside the decoded
 * notes -- and everything downstream of them (the renderer, the live player,
 * the MIDI exporter) reads that shape. An editor needs the opposite: something
 * mutable, with stable identities for undo and selection, and with a note as
 * a chain of control points it can drag one at a time. This is that shape, and
 * the two functions at the bottom are the boundary: `songFromSequencer` opens
 * a level's song for editing and `sequencerFromSong` turns the edit back into
 * exactly what the rest of the project plays.
 *
 * ❗ **The boundary goes through the game's own record encoding.** A `Track`
 * carries `records` and `notes`, and `sequencerFromSong` writes the records
 * with `encodeNotes` (the measured order, the resting bit) and then decodes
 * them again for `notes`, so the notes the player sees are the notes a level
 * saved from this song would hold -- clamped to seven bits, snapped to thirds,
 * ordered as the editor orders them. Nothing here can play a note the file
 * could not carry.
 *
 * Positions are in **thirds of a step** throughout, because that is the record
 * grid: a triplet sits at thirds 1 and 2 of a step, and a note's end is the
 * position of its last control point (the engine's gate closes a step after
 * it -- `duration = lastStep - firstStep + 1`, steering/sequencer-data-model.md).
