/**
 * An LBP instrument as Live's Sampler: the `.rinst`'s zones, samples, loops,
 * envelopes, filter and level, for a track of the `.als` export.
 *
 * ❗ **What this can be is measured, and so is where it stops.** Every member
 * below is written as Live 11.3 writes it -- the Sampler and its Shaper are
 * trees read out of Live's own Core Library (`SAMPLER`, `SHAPER`, generated,
 * never typed) -- and every number that says what a Live value means was read
 * off Live itself, a debug set opened and its device panel captured
 * (`steering/ableton-interchange.md`, *The instruments*).
 *
 * | the engine | the Sampler |
 * |---|---|
 * | a slot and its key zone (`resolveSlot`) | a zone over the same raw notes: the notes are written raw (`als.ts`), as the engine picks the slot off them |
 * | `Key`, the track's commonest | in every pitched zone's root; another part's `Key` and the scale are per-note pitch (`als.ts`) |
 * | the slot's root and fine tune | `RootKey` and `Detune`: the ratio is `2^((note − root + fine)/12)` |
 * | an unpitched slot, which plays at one rate | one zone per key, each its own root |
 * | `fitBpm`, `tempo / baseBpm` | in `Detune`: the tempo is the song's, fixed |
 * | the sample, played frame for frame at 48 kHz whatever its header says | a WAV written with a 48 kHz header, the frames verbatim (`samplerSampleFile`) |
 * | the loop, `[dwStart, dwEnd + 1)` as the game's loader reads it | the sustain loop, forward, no crossfade |
 * | the amplitude ADSR, linear, a stage time `param² × 4 s` | Live's, with linear slopes and the times the engine's rates give |
 * | the Moog ladder's cutoff, resonance, key tracking and envelope | Live's filter, low-pass, set to the same corners |
 * | `Params[24]`, the output level | the Sampler's volume; the 2 it enters the gain with is the track's (`mixerOf`) |
 * | `Params[26]`, the drive | the Shaper |
 * | the note's level and its ramp | per-note pressure, every note's (`als.ts`), through the Pressure row to Volume |
 *
 * ⚠️ **The modulation is fixed per track.** Every `Params` range is evaluated
 * at the modulation the track's notes use most -- 95.6% of the corpus's notes
 * use their part's -- because Live's Sampler routes a per-note source to two
 * destinations and an LBP instrument moves seven with it, twenty on the ray
 * gun. The notes at another value are counted, not bent.
 *
 * Not here: the unison stack, the three LFOs, the mip levels and the ladder's
 * own saturation. Each is either absent from the Sampler or would be set with
 * a unit nobody has measured; the steering says which.
