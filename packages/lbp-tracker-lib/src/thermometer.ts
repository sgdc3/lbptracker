/**
 * The sequencer's thermometer: what a board costs, as the game counts it.
 *
 * The game keeps a budget per sequencer, in bytes of sample, apart from the
 * level's thermometer. The eboot's `v0x1c4720` is the whole rule:
 *
 * ```
 * for every PInstrument on the board:
 *   if its RInstrument is loaded:
 *     for each of SampleGuids_0..7 that is not empty:   ; +0xc8 .. +0xe4
 *       set.insert(guid)                                ; v0xb3ab30, a std::set
 * for guid in set:
 *   row = file databases' row for guid                  ; v0x10680
 *   if row: total += row.size                           ; [row + 4]
 * ```
 *
 * So a second chip of the same sound is free, two instruments that share a
 * sample pay for it once -- the three pianos together cost what one does -- and
 * notes cost nothing. `v0x74b960` shows the total against `MaxSequencerMemory`,
 * which `gamedata/data/limits_settings.lmt` sets to 1,000,000, and past it the
 * game says there are "too many instruments on this sequencer".
 *
 * `dev/sequencer-memory.ts` holds this against real levels: of 183 sequencers
 * none is over and the fullest is at 999,562. The readings, and what was not
 * read, are in steering/sequencer-data-model.md.
