 * function that fills the plugin's slot -- `+0x78`, `+0x7c`, `+0x80`, `+0x94`
 * -- and calls its mip builder): `+0x7c` is `dwStart` as written, clamped to
 * the last frame; `+0x80` is `min(dwEnd + 1, frames) − start`, so `smpl`'s end
 * is inclusive and the region half-open. The loader then copies the loop's
 * first 16 frames to just past its end ({@link patchLoop}), which is what
 * makes the sampler's unwrapped second tap land on loop-start material: the
 * audible join is `d[dwEnd] → d[dwStart]`, the literal one.
 *
 * ❌ **Until 2026-09-08 this returned `[dwStart − 1, dwEnd + 1)`**, a region
 * one frame longer than the engine's, chosen by measuring which join was
 * smoothest over the corpus (`d[end] → d[start − 1]` at 0.59× the average
 * adjacent step against 3.28× for the literal one; steering/game-assets.md
 * keeps the table). Smoother, and not the game's: it lengthened every loop's
 * period by a frame -- a few cents flat on a 45 ms loop -- and bought a
 * smoothness the game does not have. If a sustained high piano note clicks
 * here and not in a capture of the game, this is the line to revisit.

/**
 * Crossfade a loop so its seam stops repeating the region's own amplitude
 * contour.
 *
 * The shipped loops are spliced cleanly but each carries its own envelope --
 * `piano_c6`'s spans 1.70 dB peak to trough over 45 ms -- so repeating one
 * modulates the output at the wrap rate and is heard as a flutter. Fading the
 * end of the loop into the material that precedes `start` removes the seam
 * itself; it does not flatten the contour, but it stops the discontinuity in
 * the contour's *slope* at the wrap, which is the audible part.
 *
 * ⚠️ **MEASURED NOT TO HELP. Kept only so the dead end is not re-explored.**
 * On `piano_c6` at F5, the envelope modulation at the wrap rate goes
 * *up*, not down, as the crossfade lengthens:
 *
 * | crossfade | none | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|---|
 * | modulation | 5.75% | 5.72% | 5.91% | 6.79% | **9.51%** |
 *
 * That is the proof that the flutter is **not the seam**: smoothing the seam
 * changes nothing, and a long fade makes it worse by mixing in the louder
 * pre-loop material. The cause is the loop region's own 1.70 dB amplitude
 * contour, which no splice can flatten. See steering/game-assets.md.
 *
 * Returns new channel buffers, leaving the originals untouched.
