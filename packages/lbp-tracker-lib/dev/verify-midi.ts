/**
 * The MIDI round trip, over the real level corpus.
 *
 *     node --experimental-strip-types packages/lbp-tracker-lib/dev/verify-midi.ts
 *
 * `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/test/midi.test.ts` pins the behaviour on fixtures small enough to reason
 * about. This is the other half: every music sequencer in the corpus, exported
 * and read back, with the scheduled note stream compared position by position.
 * Real compositions carry things a fixture will not think of -- notes that open
 * at volume zero, glides across a scale change, parts a thousand clips long --
 * and the point of a converter is that it survives them.
 *
 * What is compared is the MUSIC, not the bytes: `Key` and `Scale` are baked into
 * the note numbers on the way out, so the record fields legitimately differ.
 * See the header of `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src/midi.ts`.
 *
 * `LBP_LEVELS` is the corpus directory. Nothing here is committed.
