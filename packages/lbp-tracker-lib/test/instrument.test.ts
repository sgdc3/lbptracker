 * `resolveSlot` against the engine's own loop, transcribed instruction for

 *
 * `fmodextinput.prx` `0x0555`-`0x0577`, and verbatim again at `0x09f0`-`0x0a14`:
 *
 * ```
 * ecx = bextr(noteWord, 0x708)          ; bits 8..14, the raw note
 * eax = 0
 * loop:
 *   r8d = 0                             ; the zone, if the walk never falls through
 *   if (int)eax > 7:  goto done         ; a fixed eight bounds
 *   cmp  [rdx + rax*4 + 0x4c4], ecx     ; signed
 *   eax += 1
 *   if   bound > note:  goto loop
 *   eax -= 1
 *   r8d = eax
 * done:                                 ; -> 0x19e0, and at 0x1aca:
 *                                       ;    imul rax, rax, 0x98   -- straight
 *                                       ;    into the slot array
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ **`+0x4c4` is `Splitnotes[1]`, not `[0]`.** The DSP's instrument record is
 * eight slots of `0x98` at `+0x000`, which ends at `+0x4c0`; `Splitnotes[0]`
 * sits there and the walk never reads it. `Numstack` follows the eight bounds at
 * `+0x4e4` and `Params` at `+0x4e8`, which is checkable — `Params[11].x`, the
 * amplitude attack, is read at `+0x540` (`0x1f8c`), and `0x4e8 + 11*8 = 0x540`.
 *
 * Reading the walk as indexing from `Splitnotes[0]` is what made it look as
 * though the engine disagreed with this module. It does not: 8,704 comparisons,
 * no disagreement.
