/**
 * Stage the site for deployment: `dist/` plus the assets the pages fetch.
 *
 *     npm run stage      # vite build, then this
 *     npm run deploy     # stage, then `wrangler deploy`
 *
 * ❗ **`vite build` alone never copies `fixtures/`**, and that stands: it is
 * the property steering/game-assets.md describes, and a build that silently
 * carried game data would be the wrong kind of surprise. This script is the
 * one place that puts game data into `dist/`. It runs only when a deployment
 * is asked for, it copies exactly what the manifests name, and it prints what
 * it copied.
 *
 * What goes in: `fixtures/rinst` and `fixtures/smp` with their manifests — the
 * two directories `src/assets.ts` fetches, and nothing else. `fixtures/archive`
 * stays out: the pages read levels from archive.org directly
 * (`src/lbparchive.ts`); the local copy exists for the tests.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Names are made boring on the way.** Three samples carry a `#` and 48 a
 * space. `asset()` percent-encodes both, and the dev server and Vite's preview
 * decode them back — but whether a static host maps `%23` onto a file whose
 * name holds a `#` is the host's business, and this exact class of trap once
 * cost a day (see the header of `src/assets.ts`). The manifest is the
 * indirection built for this: the copied file is `choir_f-sharp3_v2.smp`, the
 * staged manifest says so, and `fixtures/` on disk is untouched. `publicName`
 * is the rule, and `test/stage-site.test.ts` holds it to being the identity
 * under `encodeURIComponent` over the whole real manifest.
 *
 * `_headers` is written here too, because `vite build` empties `dist/` first:
 * hashed bundles are immutable, the samples are game data that does not
 * change, and the manifests get a day.
