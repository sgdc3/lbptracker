/**
 * The browser half of the renderer: a module worker that runs
 * `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src/render.ts` off the main thread.
 *
 * It is deliberately thin. Everything musical happens in `renderSequencer`,
 * which is the same function `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/dev/render-level.ts` calls under Node, so a
 * browser render is not a reimplementation — it is the same arithmetic with a
 * different way of reading files. On 2026-09-02 a browser render and a Node
 * render of the same level came out byte-identical; see the header of
 * `packages/lbp-tracker-lib/src/render.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The level is opened by the user, and only by the user.** The page hands
 * this worker a `File` and it reads that; there is no fetch path and no fallback
 * to a copy on the host. That is not a preference, it is what lets the whole
 * thing be a static site -- a bucket cannot host other people's levels, and
 * `steering/game-assets.md` says it must not try.
 *
 * ❗ The game's own instrument definitions and samples (`fixtures/rinst`,
 * `fixtures/smp`) are **still fetched**, and they are the same class of asset.
 * They have to move to the same footing before this can be deployed anywhere.
 *
 * The file it opens is a **level**, parsed here by `packages/cwlib-ts/src/level.ts`. It used
 * to be an 81 MB JSON dump produced by a Java tool, indexed by regex and parsed
 * line by line to stay affordable in a tab; the whole level walk turns out to be
 * cheaper than that was.
