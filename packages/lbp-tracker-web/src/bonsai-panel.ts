/**
 * The fourth way to open a song: a level off Bonsai.
 *
 * The archive panel (`archive-panel.ts`) opens what Mm's servers held until
 * 2021; this opens what has been published since, to the community server LBP
 * moved to. A level fetched from Bonsai is the same resource a backup holds, so
 * this ends in the same `onOpen` as a dropped file, with the same bytes in the
 * same reader.
 *
 * ❗ **Nothing here needs a server of ours.** Bonsai's API answers any origin
 * (measured, see `bonsai.ts`), so the search, the level's metadata and every
 * resource are asked for by the page itself, from a dev server, a static host
 * or a `file://` page alike.
 *
 * ❗ **The level's own name is put in the DOM as text, never as markup**, by the
 * component and by the loader alike: it was typed by whoever published it and
 * arrived over the network.
