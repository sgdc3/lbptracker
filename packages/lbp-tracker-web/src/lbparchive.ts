/**
 * Opening a level out of the Internet Archive, by its root level's hash.
 *
 * The Mm servers were shut down in 2021 and the levels survive as an archive of
 * the official server's resource store (`archive.org/details/@tamiya99`),
 * indexed by Zaprit's LBP Search Facility, <https://zaprit.fish>. A listener
 * with no PS3 backup of their own finds a level there, copies the 40 hex digits
 * its page shows, and pastes them here.
 *
 * ❗ **This is deliberately the hash and nothing else.** The page briefly had a
 * search box that read the index through the dev server, because zaprit.fish
 * sends no CORS headers and a browser cannot ask it directly. That worked and
 * was removed: it made a listener's search go through a server that otherwise
 * only serves files, and it stopped working the moment the tracker was opened
 * anywhere but a dev machine. What is left needs no server at all.
 *
 * ✔ **Measured, 2026-09-05.** `archive.org` answers a level request from any
 * origin -- `view_archive.php` echoes whatever `Origin` is sent, verified from
 * `https://example.github.io` -- and `rootLevelUrl` below is a pure function of
 * the hash, so nothing has to be asked of anyone before the download. The
 * measurements that closed the other routes, including why the archive's own
 * 2.65 GB SQLite index cannot be read from a page, are in *The public archive*
 * in `steering/lbp-modding-toolchain.md`.
