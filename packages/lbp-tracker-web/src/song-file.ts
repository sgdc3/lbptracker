/**
 * Saving a song as this tracker's own file, from any page.
 *
 * A level's sequencer or the editor's song goes out as
 * `{ format: "lbptracker-song", version: 1, song }` (`@lbptracker/lib/song.ts`),
 * named after the song, through a download the browser owns. Reading one back
 * is `readOpened` in `open-level.ts`, which every page's drop zone goes
 * through -- so a file saved on the renderer opens in the editor, and the
 * other way round.
 *
 * ⚠️ This touches the DOM (`<a download>`), so it stays out of `open-level.ts`,
 * which a worker imports.
