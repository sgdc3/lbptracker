/**
 * The board: the sequencer's circuit board as a grid of cells, with one chip
 * per placed instrument, drawn on a canvas.
 *
 * ❗ **A canvas, not a `v-for`** -- a board is a few hundred chips on a grid
 * that scrolls and shows a playhead thirty times a second, which is what
 * steering/tracker-architecture.md says not to render as reactive components.
 * This class owns the drawing and the pointer; the page owns what a click
 * means for the rest of the screen, through the callbacks.
 *
 * A cell is 16 steps: half of one of the game's 105-unit board tiles, two of
 * its 8-step bars. A chip is a rectangle from its cell to the end of its grid
 * -- one tile for the default four bars, half a tile more per two bars -- so
 * the corpus's boards, chips two cells apart on a row, come out edge to edge.
 * Chips may overlap in time (55 of 72,726 corpus neighbours do); a translucent
 * body keeps the one underneath visible, and the selected one is drawn last.
 *
 * The pointer's vocabulary, the roll's wherever the two grids share a gesture:
 *
 * | on           | plain                                   | shift                                      | ctrl                   | right click |
 * |--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
 * | empty        | the cursor; drag to draw a chip         | rectangle: the chips it touches (with ctrl: added to the block) | — | — |
 * | a chip       | select it alone and open it; drag it -- and the block it is in -- to move | rectangle; a click: in or out of the block | in or out of the block | open it |
 * | double-click | a four-bar chip where none is anchored  |                                            |                        |             |
 *
 * The block is `selection.clips` on the state. The page's keys act on it
 * (`daw/arrange.ts`: Delete, Ctrl+C, X, V, D and A), and a drag of any chip in
 * it moves the block as one, clamped to the board.
 *
 * ❗ **The canvas is the size of its viewport, like the roll's**: `Ascetic` is
 * 15,000 pixels wide, and the bar numbers and row numbers have to stay put
 * while the board scrolls either way, so the canvas is `position: sticky` in
 * a scroller whose spacer sets the scroll size, the content is drawn offset by
 * the scroll, and the ruler and the gutter are painted over it at the canvas's
 * own edges. The scroller is resizable in height and fixed in width.
