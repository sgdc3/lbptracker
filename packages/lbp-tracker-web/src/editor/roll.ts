/**
 * The piano roll: one placement's note grid, drawn on a canvas.
 *
 * What it draws is the game's own picture of a note: a chain of control
 * points joined by straight lines, each point's size its volume and its
 * colour its timbre -- blue at 0, orange at 15 -- with a keyboard down the
 * left and a step grid that can be switched between whole steps and thirds.
 * The engine glides linearly between consecutive points, so the straight
 * line is not a drawing convention: it is what will sound -- and the line
 * carries the glide, swelling with the volume and shifting hue with the
 * timbre from one point to the next.
 *
 * ❗ **A canvas the size of the viewport, not of the grid.** 128 pitch rows by
 * 128 steps is a 3,000 by 1,700 pixel surface, twice that on a high-density
 * screen, and the playhead redraws thirty times a second; so the canvas is
 * `position: sticky` inside a scroller whose spacer sets the scroll size, and
 * only the visible window is painted, offset by the scroll. The keyboard and
 * the ruler are painted over the content at the canvas's own edges, which is
 * what makes them stay put.
 *
 * The pointer's vocabulary, all of it visible in the hint under the grid:
 *
 * | on              | plain             | shift            | alt              | right click |
 * |-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
 * | empty           | draw a note; drag for its end | rectangle (ctrl too: add to the selection) | — | — |
 * | a point         | move it, or the whole selection when there is one | volume (up/down) | timbre (up/down) | delete it |
 * | a line          | move the note, or the whole selection | —          | —                | delete note |
 * | double-click    | line: add a point; point: delete it                    |             |
 *
 * Ctrl on a point or a line adds that note to the selection, or takes it out.
 * The rectangle catches a note by a point inside it **or by a line crossing
 * it**, so a held note is caught by a rectangle drawn across its middle.
 *
 * The commands the page's keys reach are at the end of the class:
 * `deleteSelection`, `nudge`, `adjust`, `selectAll`, `copy`, `cut`, `paste`,
 * `duplicateSelection`.
