/**
 * Fetching a root level and the openable resources it depends on, from any
 * store that serves resources by their SHA-1.
 *
 * Two stores do: the Internet Archive (`lbparchive.ts`) and Bonsai
 * (`bonsai.ts`). The walk is the same over both -- the dependency table names
 * what to ask for and the bytes that come back name what to ask for next -- so
 * it lives here once and each panel hands it a `grab`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The walk fetches only what can be opened, and the list is measured.** A
 * level's dependency table names its textures, meshes and materials too, and
 * `packages/cwlib-ts/src/backup.ts` would throw every one of them away -- it
 * opens `LVLb`, `PLNb` and `CHKb` and nothing else. So the walk follows exactly
 * the three types that are those: 9, 38 and 61. See `OPENABLE_DEPENDENCIES`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A missing part is not a failed open.** Only the root is required, and
 * the panel fetches that itself so its failure can say something specific to
 * the store; anything else that will not come is counted and said out loud.
