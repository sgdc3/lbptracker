/**
 * The pages' controls: declared once each, read through a typed store.
 *
 * ❗ **This replaces two declarations per control, and sometimes three.** Until
 * 2026-09-06 a fader was written once in the page's HTML as an
 * `<input type="range">` with its `min`, `max` and `value`, once in the page's
 * module as a row carrying its formatter, and named a third element by string
 * join — `${id}Label`. Nothing checked that they agreed, and every way of
 * getting it wrong was silent:
 *
 * - a mistyped id read the neighbouring control and the page still worked;
 * - a formatter dividing by 100 beside a reader dividing by 10 showed one
 *   number while playing another;
 * - ⚠️ and on the live player, `setSlider('echoFb', seq.echoFeedback * 100)`
 *   had to be the exact inverse of `num('echoFb') / 100` — the two sat 350
 *   lines apart, and getting the pair wrong loads a song at the wrong feedback
 *   with the label agreeing.
 *
 * All three are structural now rather than avoided:
 *
 * - `Controls<FaderId, CheckId>` carries the unions from the page's own spec, so
 *   a wrong id will not compile.
 * - ❗ **`per` is one number, not two functions.** `value = raw / per` and
 *   `raw = value * per`, so reading and writing a control cannot disagree — the
 *   third failure above is not expressible.
 * - `format` is handed the **engine's** number, never the slider position, so
 *   the label and the sound come from the same value.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A store belongs to one page.** Ids repeat across pages with different
 * ranges — the bench's `tempo` is 40..300 and the live player's is 20..400 —
 * so there is no global table and `createControls` is called once per page,
 * with the store handed to the components through `provide`.
