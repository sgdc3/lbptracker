/**
 * The live player: a song scheduled into the audio thread instead of a file.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It is not a second engine, and that is the whole design.** Every voice it
 * plays comes out of `renderSequencer` itself, through the `onVoice` seam and
 * with `planOnly` set, so the key splits, the pitch formula, the modulation
 * point, the stack layers, the sends, the pan width and the voice pool's
 * stealing are all decided by exactly the code that writes the WAV. This file
 * owns only *when* a voice is handed over, never *what* it is.
 *
 * The plan is built once, up front, because the voice pool has to be: the
 * allocator needs the whole note list to decide what gets stolen, and a
 * scheduler that only looked a second ahead would steal differently from the
 * renderer and drift.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`VoiceSpec.random` and `VoiceSpec.sample` cannot cross a thread** -- one
 * is a function and the other is megabytes of mipmaps. The sample is sent once
 * per instrument slot and referenced by id; the LFO phases are plain numbers on
 * the spec (`lfoPhase`, drawn by the render, one base per note) and cross as
 * they are, so dropping `random` costs the worklet nothing.
 *
 * ❗ **One player, one app.** This was the body of the live page until the
 * editor needed to play what it edits; it moved here whole rather than being
 * written a second time, because every invariant below was paid for by a
 * listener hearing it broken (`nextIndex` never moving backwards, `handed`,
 * the pool replayed by index) and a second copy would have re-learned each of
 * them. `daw/session.ts` owns the one instance and the transport drives it;
 * this owns the clock, the plan, the pool and the worklet, and says what
 * happened through `PlayerEvents`.

   * is the note the song will play -- same slot, same pitch, same envelope,
   * same stack. The sequencer is expected to be tiny (one note, one track); it
   * is planned at its own tempo and posted with every voice's timing relative
   * to the first, with no pool, tagged below zero so a plan note can never be
   * mistaken for it. Returns the tag, for `releaseAudition`.
