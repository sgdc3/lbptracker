/**
 * The song picker's imperative façade, over `widgets/SeqPicker.vue`.
 *
 * ❗ **The façade stays because it is the right API here.** Three pages drive
 * this from event handlers — "a level opened, here are its songs", "select this
 * one without telling me" — and none of them has a Vue root for props to flow
 * down from. `setRows` / `value` / `select` are unchanged, so the call sites
 * were not touched when the markup became a component.
 *
 * The last time two of these pages grew their own copy of something this small
 * it cost a day, which is why `packages/lbp-tracker-web/src/assets.ts` exists
 * and why this is here.
