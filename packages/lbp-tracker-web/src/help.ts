/**
 * The help behind every "?" on the page: one dialog, one topic at a time.
 *
 * Written for the person using the app, not for the person building it: what a
 * control does and what to expect of it, never how it is implemented or where
 * a number was measured -- that belongs to `steering/`, which the site does not
 * ship. The views themselves carry as little prose as they can; a "?" beside a
 * card's title opens the topic for that card.
 *
 * A button opts in with `data-help="<topic>"`. The click is caught on the
 * document, so a button drawn later by Vue needs no wiring of its own.
