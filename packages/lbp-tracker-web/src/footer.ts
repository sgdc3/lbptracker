/**
 * The text footer: whose work this stands on, and whose it is not. The credit
 * line -- name, version, author, licence -- lives in the fixed status bar
 * instead (`index.html`, filled by `daw.ts`), where every view shows it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Injected rather than copied into four HTML files.** The nav is
 * duplicated markup already and it is the thing that goes stale — the same
 * reason `packages/lbp-tracker-web/src/open-level.ts` and `packages/lbp-tracker-web/src/seq-picker.ts` exist. A page opts in with
 * one import; nothing here needs a page to be edited again.
 *
 * ❗ **The disclaimer is not decoration**, and it says only what is true. It
 * used to add "no game data is included here", which was right for a tracker
 * that only ever read the user's own copy and **stops being right the moment the
 * site serves the banks itself** -- the plan of record. A footer that claims
 * more than the deployment does is worse than one that claims nothing, so what
 * is left is the trademark disclaimer, which is true either way.
 *
 * `steering/game-assets.md` now says where a deployment gets the assets is the
 * deployment's decision, and the Cloudflare deployment ships them
 * (`dev/stage-site.ts`), so the two agree.
 *
 * The first line is the project's own: the source, and where to say what broke.
 * It goes first because it is the only part of this footer a reader has any
 * reason to click; the credit and the disclaimer under it are there to be true,
 * not to be followed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **One constant for both links.** The issues page is the repository's URL
 * plus a path, so writing it out twice is a rename waiting to leave half the
 * footer pointing at nothing. The manifests are `private` and carry no
 * `repository` field to read it from, and adding one only for this would put
 * the same string in a second place.
