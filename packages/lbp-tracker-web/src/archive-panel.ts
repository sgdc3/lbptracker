/**
 * The third way to open a song: a level out of the Internet Archive.
 *
 * "Open a file" and "open a folder" both assume a listener already has a PS3
 * backup. Most do not. The official servers are gone, but every level published
 * to them survives in an archive indexed by <https://zaprit.fish>, and a root
 * level fetched from there is exactly the resource `packages/cwlib-ts/src/level.ts` already
 * reads -- so this ends in the same `onOpen` as a dropped file, with the same
 * bytes in the same reader.
 *
 * ❗ **One field, and it takes a hash.** The listener searches on zaprit.fish
 * itself -- a real search, with icons and hearts and everything this box would
 * only have imitated -- and copies the 40 hex digits from the level's page.
 * `rootLevelUrl` is a pure function of those digits and archive.org answers any
 * origin, so **nothing here needs a server**: not the dev server, not a proxy,
 * not anything. That is the whole reason the box is shaped like this; see
 * `packages/lbp-tracker-web/src/lbparchive.ts` for what was measured and what was removed.
 *
 * ❗ **The level's own name is put in the DOM as text, never as markup** -- it
 * comes out of a resource somebody wrote in 2011 and arrived over the network.
