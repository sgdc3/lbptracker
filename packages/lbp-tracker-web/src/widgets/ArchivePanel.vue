 * The third way to open a level: a root level hash, fetched straight from the

 * ❗ **It needs no server** — not even the dev one — which is why it is a hash
 * and not a search. See *The search, built and then removed* in
 * `steering/lbp-modding-toolchain.md`.
 *
 * This markup used to be a 20-line `innerHTML` string with the prose spliced
 * into it by `+`, which is why the note's default text had to be read back out
 * of the DOM (`note.textContent ?? ''`) to be restored later. It is a template
 * now and the default is just a string.

    Find a level at

    shows the <b>root level</b> hash in a box of its own, under the title. Nothing here needs a
    server: the level comes straight from the Internet Archive. <b>Whole backup</b> also fetches
    the plans, chunks and levels it depends on: slower, and usually the same songs, but it is
    where a song that was never placed in the level would be. An adventure has no world of its own
    and always takes this route.
