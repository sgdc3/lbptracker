 * The song picker: a search box over the list of songs, inside the open dialog.

 * ⚠️ **A native `<select>` with a search box beside it was the first attempt and
 * it was wrong.** Two controls for one choice, the box doing nothing until you
 * notice what it is for, and the list still a native popup that cannot show a
 * filter. The second was one field opening a floating panel, which fought the
 * dialog it lives in: a list taller than the box made the dialog scroll and
 * clipped it. So the list is simply there, in the dialog, and typing filters it.
 *
 * ❗ **The `escape()` this replaced was not decoration.** The old markup was one
 * `innerHTML` string, and only the song's *name* went through an escaper; the
 * detail column, which carries a **filename out of the opened backup**, did not.
 * A zip holding a file named `<img src=x onerror=…>` therefore ran it, and the
 * archive button downloads other people's zips by design. There is no escaper
 * here because there is nothing to escape: `{{ }}` is text.
