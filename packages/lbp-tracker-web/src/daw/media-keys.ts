/**
 * The keyboard's media keys, and the operating system's own transport, wired
 * to this one through the Media Session API.
 *
 * ❗ **A silent loop has to be playing for any of it to arrive.** The session
 * belongs to whatever the page is *playing*, and this tracker's sound comes out
 * of an `AudioWorklet`, which is not a media element: with Web Audio alone the
 * browser gives the page no session and the keys go to whatever else is open,
 * or nowhere. So a silent WAV loops in an `<audio>` element for exactly as long
 * as the transport runs, and the handlers below are what the keys then reach.
 * ⚠️ The element must not be muted and its volume must stay up: a browser hands
 * the session to audible media, and a muted element is not that. Silence is
 * fine -- nobody listens to the samples -- but silence at volume 0 is not.
 *
 * The silence is written by the project's own `writeWav`, so there is no
 * kilobyte of base64 in the source and no second WAV writer to keep in step.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`el.play()` needs a gesture.** It is only ever called from the transport
 * starting, which is a click or a key, so the promise should not reject; it is
 * caught anyway, because a rejected one is an unhandled error in the console
 * and this feature is not worth a red line.
