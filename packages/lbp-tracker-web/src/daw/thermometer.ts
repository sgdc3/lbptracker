/**
 * The sequencer's thermometer on the page: the blue one the game keeps beside
 * an open sequencer, counting bytes of sample against `MaxSequencerMemory`.
 *
 * The rule is the game's and lives in `@lbptracker/lib/thermometer.ts`; this
 * file feeds it the song and the manifests, draws the meter beside the board and
 * prices the instrument picker's rows -- the game's own message points at the
 * thermometer "to see how expensive each instrument you place is".
 *
 * ❗ **It warns, and refuses nothing.** What was read in the eboot is a message
 * when the cost goes over, not a refusal (steering/sequencer-data-model.md), and
 * a level can arrive over the limit from somebody's modded game.
