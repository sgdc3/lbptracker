 * The page's own query string: what a link to a song says, and how it is read.

 * ❗ **A link names a level by its hash and a song by its uid**, because that is
 * all either of them has for a name here: `?level=<40 hex digits>` fetches a
 * published level out of the Internet Archive (`lbparchive.ts` has where from
 * and why it needs no server), `&seq=<uid>` picks one of the sequencers inside
 * it, and `&deep=1` also fetches the resources the level depends on. Nothing
 * else is encoded, so a link costs this site nothing, survives a redeploy, and
 * works from any copy of the page including a dev server.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Everything read out of here is validated, not trusted.** The hash goes
 * into a fetch URL and the uid into a map key, and both arrive from whatever
 * somebody pasted into the address bar.
 *
 * The address bar is written back to as the reader opens things
 * (`rememberLevel`, `rememberSequencer`), so the URL is always the link to what
 * is on screen. ⚠️ **`replaceState`, never `pushState`**: opening a level is
 * not a page the Back button should have to step through.
